// https://expressjs.com/  fast and robust
// unopinionated - rails is highly opinionated (configuration and controllers need specific naming), express does not, very flexible
// minimalist - doesn't come with much where rails generates lots of things
// express is a package that needs to be installed. need a package.json file, similar to gem file. 
// to create a package json - npm init (npm init -y agrees toe everything)
