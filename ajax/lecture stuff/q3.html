get request to the covid API, data returned as a promise.
gets specific info from response (global?)
puts the result into a list that has been created with total deaths, new deaths etc as one bullet point (need to map for each point to go on a li)
appends each bullet point and unordered list to the body
can manage error if there is one
clicking the button makes the get request via event listener
